**GraphQL Inspector** ouputs a list of changes between two GraphQL schemas. Every change is precisely explained and marked as breaking, non-breaking or dangerous.
It helps you validate documents and fragments against a schema and even find similar or duplicated types.

## Features

Major features:

- **Compares schemas**
- **Finds breaking or dangerous changes**
- **Validates documents against a schema**
- **Finds similar / duplicated types**
- **Schema coverage based on documents**
- **Serves a GraphQL server with faked data and GraphQL Playground**

GraphQL Inspector has a **CLI** and also a **programatic API**, so you can use it however you want to and even build tools on top of it.

## Installation

yarn add @graphql-inspector/core
