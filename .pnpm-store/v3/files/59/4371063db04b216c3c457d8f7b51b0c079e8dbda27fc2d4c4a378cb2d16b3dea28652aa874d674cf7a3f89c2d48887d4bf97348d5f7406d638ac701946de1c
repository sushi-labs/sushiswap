 * {ERC1967Proxy}, when this contract is set as the implementation behind such a proxy.

 * reinstated if the upgrade retains upgradeability but removes the security mechanism, e.g. by replacing
 * `UUPSUpgradeable` with a custom implementation of upgrades.
 *
 * The {_authorizeUpgrade} function must be overridden to include access restriction to the upgrade mechanism.
