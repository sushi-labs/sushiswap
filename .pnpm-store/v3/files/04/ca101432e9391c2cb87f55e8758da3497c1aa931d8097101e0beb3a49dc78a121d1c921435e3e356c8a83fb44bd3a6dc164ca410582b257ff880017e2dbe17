# level-supports

> **Create a manifest describing the abilities of a [`levelup`](https://github.com/Level/levelup) or [`abstract-leveldown`](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown) db.**

## Usage

```js
const supports = require('level-supports')

db.supports = supports({
  bufferKeys: true,
  additionalMethods: {
    approximateSize: true
  }
})
```

Receivers of the db can then use it like so:

```js
if (!db.supports.permanence) {
  throw new Error('Persistent storage is required')
}

if (db.supports.bufferKeys && db.supports.promises) {
  await db.put(Buffer.from('key'), 'value')
}
```

## API

### `manifest = supports([manifest, ..])`

Given zero or more manifest objects, returns a merged and enriched manifest object that has:

- Truthy properties for each of the features listed below
- An `additionalMethods` object

For future extensibility, the properties are truthy rather than strictly typed booleans. Falsy or absent properties are converted to `false`, other values are allowed:

```js
supports().streams // false
supports({ streams: true }).streams // true
supports({ streams: {} }).streams // {}
supports({ streams: 1 }, { streams: 2 }).streams // 2
```

For consumers of the manifest this means they should check support like so:

```js
if (db.supports.streams)
```

Rather than:

```js
if (db.supports.streams === true)
```

**Note:** the manifest describes high-level features that typically encompass multiple methods of a db. It is currently not a goal to describe a full API, or versions of it.

## Features

### `bufferKeys` (boolean)

Does the db support [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) keys? May depend on runtime environment as well. Does _not_ include support of other binary types like typed arrays (which is why this is called `bufferKeys` rather than `binaryKeys`).

### `snapshots` (boolean)

Does the db have snapshot guarantees (meaning that reads are unaffected by simultaneous writes)? Must be `false` if any of the following is true:

- Reads don't operate on a [snapshot](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown#iterator)
- Snapshots are created asynchronously.

### `permanence` (boolean)

Does data survive after process exit? Is `false` for e.g. [`memdown`](https://github.com/Level/memdown), typically `true`.

### `seek` (boolean)

Does `db.iterator()` support [`seek(..)`](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown/#iteratorseektarget)?

#### `clear` (boolean)

Does db support [`db.clear(..)`](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown/#dbclearoptions-callback)? For an overview, see [Level/community#79](https://github.com/Level/community/issues/79).

### `status` (boolean)

Does db have a [`status`](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown/#dbstatus) property? Currently available on `abstract-leveldown` implementations, but not `levelup`.

### `deferredOpen` (boolean)

Can operations like `db.put()` be called without explicitly opening the db? Like so:

```js
var db = level()
db.put('key', 'value', callback)
```

Rather than:

```js
var db = level()

db.open(function (err) {
  if (err) throw err
  db.put('key', 'value', callback)
})
```

_TBD: whether this also includes methods like `isOpen()` and `isClosed()`._

### `openCallback` (boolean)

Does the db constructor take a callback?

```js
var db = level(.., callback)
```

To the same effect as:

```js
var db = level()
db.open(.., callback)
```

### `createIfMissing`, `errorIfExists` (boolean)

Does `db.open(options, ..)` support these (`leveldown`) options?

### `promises` (boolean)

Do all db methods (that don't otherwise have a return value) support promises, in addition to callbacks? Such that, when a callback argument is omitted, a promise is returned:

```js
db.put('key', 'value', callback)
await db.put('key', 'value')
```

_Note: iterators are currently exonerated because they, at the time of writing, don't support promises anywhere._

### `streams` (boolean)

Does db have the methods `createReadStream`, `createKeyStream` and `createValueStream`, following the API currently documented in `levelup`?

### `encodings` (boolean)

Do all relevant db methods take `keyEncoding` and `valueEncoding` options?

_TBD: what this means for `*asBuffer` options._

### `additionalMethods` (object)

In the form of:

```js
{
  foo: true,
  bar: true
}
```

Which says the db has two methods, `foo` and `bar`, that are not part of the `abstract-leveldown` interface. It might be used like so:

```js
if (db.supports.additionalMethods.foo) {
  db.foo()
}
```

For future extensibility, the properties of `additionalMethods` should be taken as truthy rather than strictly typed booleans. We may add additional metadata (see [#1](https://github.com/Level/supports/issues/1)).
