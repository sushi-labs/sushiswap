* Updating process
** be able to run tests locally
*** Update dependencies
** consistent style
* Throw event in separate loop should keep stack trace
* Clean up test commands
** Pull tests out to node
- Right now the node tests run very few tests (just ~specs/oboe.*.spec.js~)
- It would be good if most tests were run through node (much faster) unless they
  specifically require to be tested by the browser
- Karma could run as few tests as possible
*** Tests that use window
- /Users/JuanCaicedo/code/personal/oboe.js/test/specs/amd.integration.spec.js
- /Users/JuanCaicedo/code/personal/oboe.js/test/specs/instanceApi.unit.spec.js
  (This might be able to be abstracted)
- /Users/JuanCaicedo/code/personal/oboe.js/test/specs/oboe.component.spec.js
  (Has conditional logic)
- /Users/JuanCaicedo/code/personal/oboe.js/test/specs/oboe.integration.spec.js

* How did I update oboe?
** Get test suite passing and up to date
- Jasmine 2, phantom reliable
** Make code modular
*** Browserify vs ES6
