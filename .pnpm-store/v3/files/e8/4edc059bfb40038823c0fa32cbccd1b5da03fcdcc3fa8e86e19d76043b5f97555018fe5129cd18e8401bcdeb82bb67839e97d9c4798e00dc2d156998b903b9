## API

Exports a single function which takes a single argument, an `abstract-leveldown` compatible storage back-end for [`levelup`](https://github.com/Level/levelup). The function returns a constructor function that will bundle `levelup` with the given `abstract-leveldown` replacement. The full API is supported, including optional functions, `destroy()`, and `repair()`. Encoding functionality is provided by [`encoding-down`](https://github.com/Level/encoding-down).

The constructor function has a `.errors` property which provides access to the different error types from [`level-errors`](https://github.com/Level/errors#api).

For example use-cases, see:

-   [`level`](https://github.com/Level/level)
-   [`level-mem`](https://github.com/Level/level-mem)
-   [`level-hyper`](https://github.com/Level/level-hyper)
-   [`level-lmdb`](https://github.com/Level/level-lmdb)

Also available is a _test.js_ file that can be used to verify that the user-package works as expected.
