## Examples
### üëç Examples of **correct** code for this rule

#### Low number of states

```solidity

      pragma solidity 0.4.4;
        
        
      contract A {
                uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
      }
    
```

### üëé Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule

#### High number of states

```solidity

      contract A {
                uint private a;

        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
      }
