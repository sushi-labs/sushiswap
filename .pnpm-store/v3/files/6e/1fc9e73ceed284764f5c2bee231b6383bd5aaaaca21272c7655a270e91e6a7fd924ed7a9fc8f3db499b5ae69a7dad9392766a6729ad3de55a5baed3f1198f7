Oboe.js is an [open source](LICENCE) Javascript library
for loading JSON using streaming, combining the convenience of DOM with
the speed and fluidity of SAX.

It can parse any JSON as a stream, is small enough to be a [micro-library](http://microjs.com/#),
doesn't have dependencies, and doesn't care which other libraries you need it to speak to.

We can load trees [larger than the available memory](http://oboejs.com/examples#loading-json-trees-larger-than-the-available-ram).
Or we can [instantiate classical OOP models from JSON](http://oboejs.com/examples#demarshalling-json-to-an-oop-model),
or [completely transform your JSON](http://oboejs.com/examples#transforming-json-while-it-is-streaming) while it is being read. 

Oboe makes it really easy to start using json from a response before the ajax request completes. 
Or even if it never completes.
