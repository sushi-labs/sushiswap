## Changelog
Until this library makes it to a production release of v1.x, **minor versions may contain breaking changes to the API**.  After v1.x, semantic versioning will be honored, and breaking changes will only occur under the umbrella of a major version bump.

[@SupremeTechnopriest)(https://github.com/SupremeTechnopriest) - improved TypeScript support and documentation! :D\

- **v2.6.4** - merely a republish, attempting to solve NPM test scores vs CI/CD
- **v2.6.2** - fixes issue with using base path of "/" with route definitions starting with "/" (creating double slash)
- **v2.6.1** - fixes named export in ESM/mjs export
- **v2.6.0** - package now is hybrid export, supporting both ESM (.mjs) and CJS (.js) minified versions
- **v2.5.3** - corrects type for router.handle to return Promise<any>
- **v2.5.2** - fixes issue with arrow functions in CommonJS named exports (rare issue)
- **v2.5.1** - added context to Cloudflare ES module syntax example (credit [@jcapogna](https://github.com/jcapogna))
- **v2.5.0** - improved TypeScript docs/types (thanks [@SupremeTechnopriest](https://github.com/SupremeTechnopriest)!)
- **v2.4.9** - fixed the cursed "optional" file format capturing bug - RIP all the bytes lost
- **v2.4.6** - fixed README issues
- **v2.4.1** - fixed type errors introduced with 2.4.0
- **v2.4.0** - HUGE internal code-golfing refactor thanks to [@taralx](https://github.com/taralx)!  Super cool work on this!!!
- **v2.3.10** - fix: dots now properly escaped (e.g. /image.jpg should not match /imageXjpg)
- **v2.3.9** - dev fixes: [@taralx](https://github.com/taralx) improved QOL issues for test writers and dev installers
- **v2.3.7** - fix: :id.:format not resolving (only conditional format would match)
- **v2.3.0** - feature: request handler will be passed request.proxy (if found) or request (if not) - allowing for middleware magic downstream...
- **v2.2.0** - feature: base path (option) is now included in the route param parsing...
- **v2.1.1** - fix: should now be strict-mode compatible
- **v2.1.0** - now handles the problematic . character within a param (e.g. /:url/action with /google.com/action)
- **v2.0.7** - shaved a few more characters in the regex
- **v2.0.0** - API break: `Router({ else: missingHandler })` has been replaced with `router.all('*', missingHandler)`, and now "all" channel respects order of entry
- **v1.6.0** - added { else: missingHandler } to options for 404 catch-alls (thanks to the discussion with [@martinffx](https://github.com/martinffx))
- **v1.5.0** - added '.all(route, handler)' handling for passthrough middleware
- **v1.4.3** - fixed nested routers using simple "/" routes
- **v1.4.1** - fixed typings for extra args (thanks [@rodrigoaddor](https://github.com/rodrigoaddor))
- **v1.4.0** - adds support for optional format params (e.g. "/:id.:format?" --> { params: { id: '13', format: 'jpg' }})
- **v1.3.0** - adds support for multiple args to handle(request, ...args) method (@hunterloftis)
- **v1.2.2** - fix: require verify/build pass before publishing and fixed README badges (should point to v1.x branch)
- **v1.2.0** - feature: chainable route declarations (with test)... that didn't take long...
- **v1.1.1** - updated README to reflect that chaining actually never was working... (not a breaking change, as no code could have been using it)
- **v1.1.0** - feature: added single option `{ base: '/some/path' }` to `Router` for route prefixing, fix: trailing wildcard issue (e.g. `/foo/*` should match `/foo`)
- **v1.0.0** - production release, stamped into gold from x0.9.7
- **v0.9.0** - added support for multiple handlers (middleware)
- **v0.8.0** - deep minification pass and build steps for final module
- **v0.7.0** - removed { path } from  request handler context, travis build fixed, added coveralls, improved README docs
- **v0.6.0** - added types to project for vscode intellisense (thanks [@mvasigh](https://github.com/mvasigh))
- **v0.5.4** - fix: wildcard routes properly supported
