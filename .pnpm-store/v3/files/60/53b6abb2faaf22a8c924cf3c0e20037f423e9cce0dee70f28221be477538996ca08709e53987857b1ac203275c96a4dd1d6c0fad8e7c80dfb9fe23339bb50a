# Roadmap

An overview of what the core Solhint team is looking to work on over the next few months.

As a caveat - this is a living doc, and will evolve as priorities grow and shift. The Solhint project will always be adapting to new use-cases and evolutions in the blockchain world - this roadmap is more of a "North Star" of what we're looking to work on than a strict timeline.

Please feel free to fill issues on this repository if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions.
