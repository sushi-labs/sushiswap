`deferred-leveldown` implements the basic [abstract-leveldown](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown) API so it can be used as a drop-in replacement where `leveldown` is needed.

`put()`, `get()`, `del()`, `batch()` and `clear()` operations are all queued and kept in memory until the `abstract-leveldown`-compatible object has been opened through `deferred-leveldown`'s `open()` method.

`batch()` operations will all be replayed as the array form. Chained-batch operations are converted before being stored.

```js
const deferred  = require('deferred-leveldown')
const leveldown = require('leveldown')

const db = deferred(leveldown('location'))

db.put('foo', 'bar', function (err) {

})

db.open(function (err) {
  // ...
})
```
