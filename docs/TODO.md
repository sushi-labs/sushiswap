# TODO
 
- [x] Initial configuration
- [x] Port tests
- [ ] Deployments
- [ ] Convert to TS (I didn't notice a huge performance loss, trade off is worth it for benefits)
- [ ] Integrate TypeChain into the build pipeline so that TypeScript types for contracts are generated and can be distributed (Also need to do this on BentoBox)
