        answer: (
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              Flash loans are loans that can be taken by anyone without having to put out any collateral. It is possible
              to make such a transaction because everything is repaid in the same block.
            </p>
            <p>
              The entire process is executed by a smart contract. If the smart contract detects that the loan will not
              be fully repaid in the same block, the transaction will be rejected.
            </p>
            <p>Platforms that allow the usage of flash loans usually charge a fee - for Bentobox it is 0.05%.</p>
            <p>
              Flash loans are particularly useful for arbitrage and liquidations. It is very capital efficient as bots
              and users do not need to have high amount of idle funds in their wallets to execute the trade.

            Classic pools made through the Trident framework have new additional capabilities that legacy pools do not.
            Legacy pools use the old AMM framework and stick to a 0.3% base fee structure. Trident classic pools have
            adjustable fees (anywhere from 0.01% to 1%) and can use TWAP pricing oracles.

            Constant Product Pools (AMMs) are pools that DeFi users are most familiar with, where trading happens
            between two assets over the x*y=k constant product formula. ‘Constant Product’ pools are composed 50% of one
            token and 50% of another. They’re best for pairing tokens that are unpredictable.

        question: 'What is a Stable Swap Pool?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Stable Pools are liquidity pools set particularly for pairs of pegged assets. This applies not just to
            stable coins, but also other assets such a wBitcoin to renBTC or wETH to stETH. Unlike regular constant
            product pools where you would see a somewhat large margin of slippage, these stable pools allow users to
            trade straight across these assets with minimal price impact.

              A 2x reward farm allows a user to earn $SUSHI & an addition token as a reward when their SLP tokens are
              staked in it. These are extra rewards added on top of the trading fees earned from providing liquidity.

            <p>
              A challenge for crosschain bridges so far has been finding a path with sufficient liquidity on both sides
              of a swap. We solve this problem by plugging into our own Sushi liquidity pools, which are currently
              deployed on 14 chains. Being able to use this liquidity guarantees our users to always receive the best
              price for any pair across all the chains.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sushi’s swap routing finds the cheapest, fastest and most secure route for any user to get from point A to
              point B by plugging into Layer0’s Stargate bridge infrastructure. Stargate bridges chains securely without
              compromising on decentralization, which allows SushiXSwap to scale to any number of chains in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              To further ensure we can always find the cheapest route and best price between any two tokens on all
              chains, we will continue to aggregate more bridges in the future. By building SushiXSwap in a modular,
              composable way, we will simplify the integration of your favorite bridge into our aggregator interface.

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              Both Aave & Compound use a pool-based system which tags their funds to various tokens on their platforms.
              This means that the solvency of any token will affect the entire platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              {"Kashi's"} isolated lending architecture mitigates the risks to a specific pair only, thus enabling any
              token to be listed as an asset/collateral. It uses an elastic interest rate to incentivize liquidity into
              a certain range and oracles to provide price feeds for all tokens.

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              Furo is a payment streaming platform that anyone can use to make automated payments to other wallets -
              whether they be for individuals, DAOs, or any other type of entity. While it my seem very similar to apps
              like Sablier or Llamapay, there are additional features which make Furo particularly appealing. One of
              these strengths would be the utilization of the BentoBox architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other apps require funds to be locked in contract. With Furo, tokens sit inside of the BentoBox giving
              potential for them to also simultaneously be utilized by strategies to accrue yield. This provides a
              pleasant way to have your value grow before you even receive it! Streams and vesting that are sent via
              Furo are also represented by an NFT minted to the receiving wallet. The owner can even send that NFT to
              another wallet to transfer ownership of the stream.

        question: 'What is a Dutch auction?',
        answer: (
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              Dutch auctions are “inverted” auctions. The price point per token is set high and descends as the auction
              goes on in the event that no one is buying in. This rate of price adjustment is set by the auctioneer. The
              final price per token is set when all tokens have been allocated. Participants are committing to receive a
              minimum total value rather than bidding for the tokens themselves - because of this it is common to end up
              with more tokens than what was initially bid for.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Example:</i> An auction starts at $100 per token. It is set to depreciate in value every hour if a
              token is not bought. If no one buys the token after the first hour, it automatically lowers itself to the
              price point of $90 per token. Every purchase resets the hour long timer until the token price starts to
              depreciates again. If no tokens are bought in the second hour - again the price of the token drops, this
              time to $80. Another hour passes, now it is valued at $70. This cycle would continue until all the tokens
              are purchased or they become valued at $0.

        question: 'What is a Batch auction?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Batch auctions are based around a single pool of tokens that is split amongst all auction participants. At
            the end of the auction the token price is determined by the total amount raised from all participants.
            Everybody participating gets a share of the tokens equal to their share of the contribution pool.
