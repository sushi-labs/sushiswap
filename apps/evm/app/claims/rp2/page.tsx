          <h1>RouteProcessor2 Exploit</h1>
          <span>
            On April 8, 2023, Sushi core contributors soft launched V3 upgrades for the protocol that included a new
            router called RouteProcessor2 to facilitate swaps from the frontend. The router was planned to be used
            across each iteration of Sushiâ€™s AMM pools (v2, Trident, v3), and to also be used for future aggregating
            across other protocols (Uni, Pancake, etc.). The RouteProcessor2 contract was deployed to 14 networks
            including: Arbitrum, Arbitrum Nova, Avalanche, Boba, BSC, Ethereum, Fantom, Fuse, Gnosis, Moonbeam,
            Moonriver, Optimism, Polygon, and Polygon ZkEVM. Unfortunately the contract had a critical vulnerability. To
            read more about what happened, please refer to our{' '}

            We highly recommend you revoke approval even if you have no hacked funds. Without revoking approval you
            remain vulnerable and funds can get hacked later on.
